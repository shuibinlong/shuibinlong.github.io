Hi there. Welcome to Strawberry's blog.

I am currently a master student in Natural Language Processing, Beijing Institute of Technology. I also got my bachelor's degree there.

My research interests include recommended system and graph neural network.

I used to be an ACM-ICPC candidate, but now retired.

You can reach me by [dragon60066@163.com](mailto:dragon60066@163.com).

May you enjoy every moment of programming!
